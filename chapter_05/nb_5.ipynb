    "The fundamental idea behind SVMs is to find a decision boundary that not only separates the classes but also stays as far away from the closest training instances as possible. This is called **large margin classification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The decision boundary is the solid line in the middle of a \"street.\"\n",

    "#### Hard Margin vs. Soft Margin\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Hard Margin Classification:** Strictly imposes that all instances must be off the street and on the correct side. This has two problems:\n",
    "    * It only works if the data is perfectly linearly separable.\n",
    "    * It is very sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Soft Margin Classification:** A more flexible model that finds a balance between keeping the street as large as possible and limiting the **margin violations** (i.e., instances that end up in the middle of the street or on the wrong side).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scikit-Learn's SVM classes, this balance is controlled by the `C` hyperparameter:\n",
    "* **Low `C`:** A wider street, but more margin violations (more regularization).\n",
    "* **High `C`:** A narrower street, but fewer margin violations (less regularization).\n",
