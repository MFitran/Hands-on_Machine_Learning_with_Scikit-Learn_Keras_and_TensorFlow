    "The general idea is to tweak parameters iteratively in order to minimize a cost function. It works by:\n",
    "1.  Starting with random parameter values (random initialization).\n",

    "3.  Taking a step in the direction of the *descending* gradient (downhill).\n",
    "4.  Repeating until the algorithm converges to a minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key hyperparameter is the **learning rate**, which determines the size of the steps. \n",

    "* If the learning rate is **too large**, the algorithm may jump across the valley and diverge, failing to find a good solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Scaling:** Gradient Descent is very sensitive to feature scales. If features have different scales, the cost function will be an elongated bowl. GD will take a long time to converge. **You must scale the data (e..g, using `StandardScaler`) before using GD.**"
