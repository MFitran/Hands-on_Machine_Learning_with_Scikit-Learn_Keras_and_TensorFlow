    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, the architecture that powers modern computer vision. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key topics covered include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Visual Cortex:** Inspiration for CNNs is drawn from the hierarchical architecture of the visual cortex, with its local receptive fields.\n",
    "* **Convolutional Layers:** The core building block of CNNs. We learn how they work using **filters** (or kernels) that detect local patterns. We explore key hyperparameters like **padding** (`\"valid\"` vs. `\"same\"`) and **stride**.\n",
    "* **Pooling Layers:** Used to subsample (shrink) the feature maps, reducing computational load, memory usage, and the number of parameters, which helps limit overfitting. We cover **max pooling** and **global average pooling**.\n",
    "* **CNN Architectures:** We assemble convolutional and pooling layers to build a simple CNN. We then explore the history and architecture of several landmark models:\n",
    "    * **LeNet-5:** The pioneering CNN for digit recognition.\n",
    "    * **AlexNet:** The model that won the 2012 ImageNet challenge and proved the power of deep CNNs.\n",
    "    * **GoogLeNet:** Introduced the *inception module*, allowing for much deeper and more efficient networks.\n",
    "    * **ResNet:** Introduced the *residual unit* (or skip connection), which made it possible to train extremely deep networks (e.g., 152 layers) by tackling the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "    * **Xception & SENet:** More recent architectures that introduced *depthwise separable convolutions* and *squeeze-and-excitation* blocks for even better performance and efficiency.\n",
    "* **Transfer Learning:** How to use pretrained models from `keras.applications` (like ResNet-50) to build powerful image classifiers for new tasks, even with little data.\n",
    "* **Other CV Tasks:** We go beyond simple classification to look at:\n",
    "    * **Classification and Localization:** Predicting both the class *and* a bounding box for a single object.\n",
    "    * **Object Detection:** Using Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) and architectures like YOLO (You Only Look Once) to detect multiple objects in an image.\n",
    "    * **Semantic Segmentation:** Classifying every single pixel in an image to identify which object it belongs to, using an FCN with upsampling (transposed convolutional layers)."

    "\n",
    "### Theoretical Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **convolutional layer** is the most important building block of a CNN. \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Local Receptive Fields:** Unlike neurons in a dense layer, neurons in a convolutional layer are not connected to every pixel in the input image. Instead, they are connected only to a small rectangular region of the previous layer, known as their **receptive field**.\n",
    "2.  **Filters (or Kernels):** A neuron's weights form a small image the size of the receptive field. This set of weights is called a **filter**. A filter is slid across the entire input image, producing a **feature map**. This feature map highlights the areas of the image that activate the filter (e.g., a filter might detect vertical edges, another horizontal edges, etc.).\n",
    "3.  **Weight Sharing:** All neurons in a single feature map share the *same* filter (weights and bias). This dramatically reduces the number of parameters in the model and makes it so that a pattern learned in one part of the image can be detected in any other part.\n",
    "4.  **Padding:** To ensure the output feature map has the same spatial dimensions (height/width) as the input, we often add zeros around the input, a technique called **zero padding**. In Keras, this is set by `padding=\"same\"`. The alternative, `padding=\"valid\"`, means no padding is applied, so the feature map will be smaller.\n",
    "5.  **Stride:** The **stride** is the step (in pixels) the filter takes as it slides across the image. A stride of 1 means the filter shifts one pixel at a time. A stride of 2 means it shifts two pixels, resulting in a feature map that is half the height and width.\n",
    "6.  **Multiple Channels:** An input image typically has 3 color channels (RGB). A convolutional layer applies its filters across all input channels. If the layer has *n* filters, it will output *n* feature maps. These feature maps form the input for the next layer."

    "* **Max Pooling (`MaxPool2D`):** This is the most common type. It takes the *maximum* value from its receptive field. This \"survives\" only the strongest activations, discarding the weaker ones.

This allows the network to learn the *identity function* easily, and gradients can flow \"skipped\" across the block. The network is then trained to learn the *residual* (`h(x) - x`), which is often easier to learn than the full function `h(x)`."

    "* **Object Detection:** The task of classifying and localizing *multiple* objects in an image. This is much harder than localizing one object.\n",
    "    * **Fully Convolutional Network (FCN):** A key idea is to replace the `Dense` layers at the top of a CNN with `Conv2D` layers. This allows the network to be *slid* across an image of any size and output a grid of predictions, making it much more efficient than running a classifier on many small patches of the image.\n",
    "    * **YOLO (You Only Look Once):** A popular one-step object detection architecture. It divides the image into a grid. For each grid cell, it predicts 5 bounding boxes (plus an \"objectness\" score for each) and class probabilities. It's extremely fast (can run in real-time).\n",
    "    * **Non-Max Suppression:** A post-processing step used to clean up the many bounding boxes predicted by an object detector. It finds the box with the highest objectness score and suppresses all other boxes that overlap significantly with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Semantic Segmentation:** The task of classifying *every pixel* in an image. For example, all pixels belonging to a car are colored blue, all pixels for a road are colored gray, etc. \n",
    "    * The challenge is that regular CNNs *downsample* the image (lose spatial resolution) as it goes through pooling layers.\n",
    "    * A common solution is to use an FCN (like ResNet) as an encoder, and then add an **upsampling** path (a **decoder**). \n",
    "    * Upsampling is often done using a **transposed convolutional layer** (`Conv2DTranspose`), which learns to go from a small feature map to a larger one. Skip connections are also added from the encoder to the decoder to help recover the fine-grained spatial information that was lost during downsampling."
