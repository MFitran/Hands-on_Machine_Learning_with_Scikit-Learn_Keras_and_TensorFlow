    "## 1. What Is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning** is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can **learn from data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of writing explicit rules to solve a problem, you provide a large amount of data to an ML algorithm, which learns patterns and builds a *model* to solve the problem on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more engineering-oriented definition comes from Tom Mitchell:\n",
    "> \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a **spam filter** (Task T) learns by analyzing examples of spam and non-spam emails (Experience E). Its performance (Performance P) can be measured by how accurately it classifies new, unseen emails."

    "### Why Use Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "ML is a powerful tool to replace complex, hard-to-maintain, rule-based systems. It excels in several areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Problems with no traditional solution:** For many complex problems (like speech recognition), traditional rule-based approaches are unmanageable. ML algorithms can often find a solution.\n",
    "* **Replacing complex rule lists:** A single ML model can often simplify and replace long lists of hand-tuned rules, performing better and being easier to maintain.\n",
    "* **Adapting to new data:** ML systems can be designed to adapt to new, unseen data, making them ideal for fluctuating environments (e.g., a spam filter learning about new spam techniques).\n",
    "* **Gaining insights from data:** ML can help humans discover unexpected patterns and trends in large datasets. This is known as *data mining*."

    "## 2. Types of Machine Learning Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "ML systems can be categorized based on three main criteria."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### 2.1. Based on Human Supervision\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most common categorization, based on the type and amount of supervision the algorithm receives during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Supervised Learning\n",
    "The training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called **labels**. It's like learning with a teacher.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Classification:** The task is to predict a discrete *class* or *category*. The spam filter is a classic example (spam vs. ham).\n",
    "* **Regression:** The task is to predict a continuous *numeric value*. Predicting a house price based on its features (size, location) is a regression task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Supervised Algorithms:**\n",
    "* k-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "* Linear Regression\n",
    "* Logistic Regression\n",
    "* Support Vector Machines (SVMs)\n",
    "* Decision Trees and Random Forests\n",
    "* Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "The training data is **unlabeled**. The system tries to learn patterns and structure from the data on its own, without a teacher.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clustering:** The task of grouping similar instances together into *clusters* (e.g., segmenting customers based on their purchasing habits).\n",
    "* **Anomaly Detection (Outlier Detection):** The task of identifying instances that deviate strongly from the norm (e.g., detecting credit card fraud).\n",
    "* **Visualization & Dimensionality Reduction:** The task of simplifying complex, high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional (e.g., 2D or 3D) representation that can be plotted and analyzed.\n",
    "* **Association Rule Learning:** The task of discovering interesting relationships between attributes in large datasets (e.g., \"customers who buy diapers also tend to buy beer\").\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Semisupervised Learning\n",
    "These algorithms can work with data that is **partially labeled**—typically a lot of unlabeled data and a small amount of labeled data. Google Photos, which learns to recognize faces from just one label per person, is a good example.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Reinforcement Learning (RL)\n",
    "This is a very different approach. The learning system, called an **agent**, observes an **environment**, selects and performs **actions**, and in return gets **rewards** or **penalties**. It must learn by itself what is the best strategy, called a **policy**, to maximize its cumulative reward over time. A self-driving car learning to drive is a good example of RL."

    "### 2.2. Based on Learning Method\n",
    "\n",
    "This criterion concerns whether the system can learn incrementally from a stream of incoming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Batch Learning (Offline Learning):** The system is trained using all available data at once. It learns offline, and then is launched into production where it no longer learns. To learn from new data, it must be retrained from scratch on the full dataset.\n",
    "* **Online Learning (Incremental Learning):** The system is trained incrementally by feeding it data instances sequentially, either individually or in small groups called **mini-batches**. This is great for systems that need to adapt to change rapidly (e.g., stock market prediction) or for datasets that are too large to fit in one machine's memory."

    "* **Instance-Based Learning:** The system learns the training examples by heart. When given a new instance, it uses a **similarity measure** to compare it to the learned examples and makes a prediction based on the most similar ones. (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors).\n",
    "* **Model-Based Learning:** The system builds a **model** from the training data, which is a (simplified) representation of the data. This model is then used to make predictions. The code example below demonstrates this approach."

    "## 4. Main Challenges of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The chapter highlights that the two main things that can go wrong are \"bad data\" and \"bad algorithms.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1. Bad Data (Data Problems)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Insufficient Quantity of Training Data:** Most ML algorithms need a lot of data to work properly. Deep Learning models, in particular, can require millions of examples.\n",
    "* **Nonrepresentative Training Data:** The data used for training must be representative of the new cases you want to generalize to. If it's not, the model will be biased (e.g., training a self-driving car only on sunny days). This can be caused by:\n",
    "    * *Sampling Noise:* The sample is too small, so it's nonrepresentative by chance.\n",
    "    * *Sampling Bias:* The sampling method itself is flawed (e.g., polling people only by phone).\n",
    "* **Poor-Quality Data:** Data full of errors, outliers, and noise will make it difficult for the model to detect underlying patterns.\n",
    "* **Irrelevant Features:** The data must contain relevant features. The process of finding the best features to train on is called **feature engineering**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2. Bad Algorithms (Algorithm Problems)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Overfitting the Training Data:** The model performs well on the training data, but it does not generalize well to new instances. This happens when the model is *too complex* relative to the amount and noisiness of the data. It learns the noise, not the underlying pattern.\n",
    "    * **Solutions:** Simplify the model, gather more data, or reduce the noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Underfitting the Training Data:** The model is *too simple* to learn the underlying structure of the data. It performs poorly even on the training data.\n",
    "    * **Solutions:** Select a more powerful model, feed better features to the algorithm (feature engineering), or reduce the constraints on the model."

    "## 5. Testing and Validating\n",

    "The only way to know how well a model will generalize to new cases is to try it out on new cases. To do this, you split your data into distinct sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Training Set:** Used to train the model (typically ~80% of the data).\n",
    "* **Test Set:** Used to estimate the model's performance on new, unseen data (the *generalization error*) after the model is trained. You *never* look at or use the test set during training.\n",
    "* **Validation Set (or Development Set):** When you need to tune your model's **hyperparameters** (e.g., the `k` in k-Nearest Neighbors), you can't use the test set, or you will overfit to it. A common solution is to hold out part of the training set as a validation set. You train multiple models with different hyperparameters on the (reduced) training set, evaluate them on the validation set, and select the best one.\n"
