    "This notebook serves as the submission for **Chapter 2** of the book *\"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter Objective:** This chapter walks through an example project end-to-end, pretending to be a data scientist at a real estate company. The goal is to build a model of housing prices in California using census data.\n",

    "Before diving into the code, it's essential to understand the project's objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Frame the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The first task is to define the business objective. In this case, the model's output (a prediction of a district's median housing price) will be fed into another Machine Learning system to determine whether it's worth investing in a given area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this, we can frame the problem:\n",
    "* **Supervised Learning:** Yes, because we are given labeled training examples (each instance has a known median housing price).\n",
    "* **Regression Task:** Yes, because we are asked to predict a continuous numeric value (the median housing price). This is a *multiple regression* problem as we will use multiple features to make the prediction.\n",
    "* **Batch Learning:** Yes, because there is no continuous flow of new data, and the dataset is small enough to fit in memory. Plain batch learning is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Select a Performance Measure\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical performance measure for regression problems is the **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**. It gives an idea of how much error the system typically makes in its predictions, with a higher weight given to large errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$RMSE(\\mathbf{X}, h) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (h(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2}$$\n",
