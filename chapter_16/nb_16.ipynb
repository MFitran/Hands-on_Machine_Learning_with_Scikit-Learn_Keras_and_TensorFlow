    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter dives into the techniques required to process sequential data, with a special focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for Text:** We begin by building a **Character RNN (Char-RNN)** to generate original text, one character at a time. This introduces key data preparation techniques for sequential data, such as creating a `tf.data.Dataset` from text, using the `window()` method to create sequential windows, and building both **stateless** and **stateful RNNs**[cite: 943, 948].\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Sentiment Analysis:** We then move from character-level to word-level models. We build an RNN to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDb movie review dataset. This section covers crucial NLP preprocessing steps, including:\n",
    "    * Word-level tokenization.\n",
    "    * Encoding words to integers using a vocabulary lookup table.\n",
    "    * Using **masking** (via `mask_zero=True`) to handle variable-length sequences (i.e., padding) efficiently[cite: 955].\n",
    "    * Using **word embeddings** (`Embedding` layer) to represent words as dense, trainable vectors[cite: 954].\n",
    "    * Reusing **pretrained word embeddings** from TensorFlow Hub for transfer learning [cite: 957-958].\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Neural Machine Translation (NMT):** The chapter introduces the **Encoder-Decoder** architecture, a powerful model for sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) tasks like translation[cite: 959]. We explore:\n",
    "    * The concept of an encoder (reading the source sentence) and a decoder (generating the target sentence).\n",
    "    * **Bidirectional RNNs** to capture information from both directions of a sequence[cite: 963].\n",
    "    * **Beam search** to improve prediction quality by keeping track of several candidate translations instead of just one[cite: 964].\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Attention Mechanisms:** We explore the key limitation of the basic Encoder-Decoder model (the bottleneck of the final hidden state) and solve it with **attention**[cite: 966].\n",
    "    * Attention allows the decoder to look back at the *entire* input sequence at each step, focusing on the most relevant parts.\n",
    "    * We discuss the two main types: **Bahdanau (additive)** and **Luong (multiplicative)** attention[cite: 968].\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **The Transformer Architecture:** Finally, we move beyond RNNs entirely to the **Transformer**, the model introduced in the \"Attention Is All You Need\" paper[cite: 969]. This is the state-of-the-art architecture that powers models like BERT and GPT.\n",
    "    * It relies exclusively on attention mechanisms (no recurrent or convolutional layers).\n",
    "    * Key components include **Positional Embeddings** (to inject word order information) and **Multi-Head Attention** (which allows the model to pay attention to multiple things simultaneously)[cite: 970, 972].\n",
    "\n",
    "The chapter concludes with a look at recent state-of-the-art language models like BERT, ELMo, and GPT-2, which are all built upon the concepts of pretraining and the Transformer architecture [cite: 975-976]."

By wrapping the `Dense` layer in `TimeDistributed`, we apply the *same* `Dense` layer to each of the `n_steps` time steps independently.

    ">     -   **Scaled Dot-Product Attention:** For each word, the model learns three vectors: a **Query (Q)**, a **Key (K)**, and a **Value (V)**. The Query (a word's question) is compared (via dot product) to every other word's Key. The resulting scores are scaled and softmaxed to get attention weights. These weights are then used to get a weighted sum of all the Values. This is the new representation for that word[cite: 971].\n",
